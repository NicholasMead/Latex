\footnotesize{
An enthusiastic and dedicated professional, I am passionate about designing and building new and exciting technology. I've worked with a wide range of software and programming languages, both professionally and academically spanning hardware design to global scale software automation.

Outside the office I am easy-going and adventurous. I enjoy exercise, the company of my family and friends, and learning new things. I have a varied range of hobbies from photography to hot air ballooning.}

\section{Experience}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{12.5cm}}
    \textsc{September 2016}
        & \textbf{Pilot Automation in Financial Sector} | \emph{Symphony Ventures}\\
    \textsc{ - Present}
        & \footnotesize{Together with a small team, I've designed and build a large scale automation for one of the world largest companies. I was responsible for the technical design of the project, and managing the work for three developers. I have been at the front of client meetings both in the UK and the US on multiple occasions and have a strong business report with the project directors and senior investors.}\\

    \textsc{June 2016}
        & \textbf{Pilot Automation in Distribution Sector} | \emph{Symphony Ventures}\\
    \textsc{ - September 2016}
        & \footnotesize{Single handed, I developed the first automation deployed into a global brands European shared service operation. From concept to production, I was responsible for the design, implementation and testing of the solution - leaning from the experience and knowledge of senior management. I lead meetings with the client, provided detailed reports on the project status to senior directors and ensured the project was a ground breaking success.}\\

    \textsc{September 2015}
        & \textbf{FPGA Development, LHCb Vertex Locator Upgrade} | \emph{University of Manchester}\\
    \textsc{ - May 2016}
        & \footnotesize{My role in the project was to create a pre-cpu data analysis chip that performed a crucial optimisation algorithm. My work allows the main data analysis clusters to prioritise easier to processes data sets, clearing them from memory to prevent data build-up.}\\
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\
    \textsc{January 2015}
        & \textbf{Measuring Fundamental Symmetries at the LHC} | \emph{University of Manchester}\\
    \textsc{- March 2015}
        & \footnotesize{In this project, I analysed the data from 8.5 million LHCb particle collisions in order to measure the fundamental symmetry of matter and antimatter. To deal with the large data set, I wrote an analysis program in C++ and used the particle physics data analysis library `ROOT' to present my results.}\\
        & \footnotesize{My work was well received by my supervising Professor who specifically praised the professional standard of my work - far beyond that expected of an undergraduate student.}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\
    \textsc{February 2009}
        & \textbf{Part-Time and Summer Work}\\
        & \footnotesize{From the age of 16, I have worked part time and summers along side my studies. I've always been a reliable and hard working employee. I enjoy being in a team, but also being alone to focus. I believe in working hard and being proud of what I achieve.}\\
